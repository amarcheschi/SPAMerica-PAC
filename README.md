Spam america's pac database with plausible but fake data

I've recently read about America PAC's data collection, which adopts a different behaviour for people living in the swing states. It doesn't even redirects you to the appropriate site where you can actually register for a vote. Since door to door canvassing can be a focus for america pac, i wrote a script that spams data that is fake but plausible

All that's needed to run the script is to install random address https://pypi.org/project/random-address/ and just start main.py. It will work in the background. If Firefox webdriver isn't installed, choose a different webdriver in main
